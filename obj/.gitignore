# Stuff to ignore in "obj/x86_64":
# - apply rules from parent
# - ignore all the ".o" files
#
# Note that this file exists to prevent Git
# from removing the "obj" directory if we
# happen to commit with no .o files present,
# which means my build system does not have
# to handle creating the "obj" directory.
